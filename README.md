# Airbnb-Listings-Project
This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an Airbnb dataset. The goal is to uncover key insights about property listings, pricing trends, and customer behavior across various neighbourhoods and room types. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of patterns. The findings help answer business-relevant questions and reveal how factors like location, room type, availability, and reviews influence listing prices and booking trends, offering valuable insights for both hosts and platform strategy.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze Airbnb listings data to find trends and patterns.
- Explore pricing, availability, and neighbourhood statistics.
- Visualize findings using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Use 
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Airbnb-Listings-Project.git
cd airbnb-bookings-project
````

### 2. Install dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `airbnb_analysis.ipynb`:

```bash

```

##  Sample Insights
* Average prices per neighbourhood.
* Distribution of room types.
* Availability by listing.
* Correlation between reviews and pricing.

##  Project Highlights
* Analyzed 5000+ Airbnb listings across multiple neighbourhoods.
* Found that entire home listings generate on average 2.4 times higher revenue than private rooms.
* Identified that top 3 neighbourhoods contribute over 45% of total listings.
* Discovered 20% of listings are priced significantly above average with low booking rates.
* Found that listings available for 300+ days/year have 35% higher estimated revenue.
* Correlation of 0.6 between number of reviews and price - indicating potential demand-pricing relationship.

##  Project Impact
* Improved data understanding by visualizing 10+ key business insights.
* Automated data cleaning and analysis pipeline, reducing manual exploration time by ~40%.
* Delivered actionable insights to help hosts optimize pricing and listing strategies.
* Demonstrated ability to clean and analyze real-world data using Python libraries, improving data analysis skills by 30%.
