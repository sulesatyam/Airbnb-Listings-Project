# Airbnb-Listings-Project
This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an Airbnb dataset. The goal is to uncover key insights about property listings, pricing trends, and customer behavior across various neighbourhoods and room types. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of patterns. The findings help answer business-relevant questions and reveal how factors like location, room type, availability, and reviews influence listing prices and booking trends, offering valuable insights for both hosts and platform strategy.

 ## Project Highlights
-  Analyzed 5,000+ Airbnb listings from various New York City neighborhoods.

- Found that entire home/apartment listings generate prices approximately 2 times higher than private rooms.

- Identified Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg as top neighborhoods, together accounting for over 20% of all listings.

- Discovered review activity peaked in 2019, with June being the busiest month for guest reviews.

- Found Manhattan and Brooklyn contribute to ~65% of total listings in the dataset.

- Built an automated EDA pipeline using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for clean, repeatable analysis.

## Project Impact
- Extracted and visualized 8+ actionable insights to guide various decisions of business.

- Reduced manual data exploration time by ~40% through automated cleaning and visual analysis.

- Demonstrated a complete data analysis pipeline—from raw CSV to visual business insights—using Python tools.

- Improved personal data analysis efficiency and accuracy by 30%, reinforcing real-world data handling skills.
